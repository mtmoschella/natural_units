# natural_units
A simple natural units conversion package for `astropy` python.

This module is used for converting (astropy) units from physical units
to natural units where $\hbar=c=1$, with the convention that the unique
remaining 'natural' dimension is energy (eV by default).
This module also contains useful constants in physical astropy units,
specifically: `mpl`, `c`, `hbar`, `G`, `eps0`
